This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV. It captures live video from your webcam, detects faces, and draws rectangles around them.

#Features
-> Captures live video using the system webcam.
-> Detects human faces in real-time.
-> Draws rectangles around detected faces.
-> Simple, beginner-friendly implementation.

#Technologies Used
-> Python 3
-> OpenCV (cv2)
